# Website-Security-Scanner
A command-line tool built with Python to perform basic security audits on websites, checking for open ports and analyzing security headers.


Step 1: Create the requirements.txt File
First, a best practice for Python projects is to include a requirements.txt file that lists all the libraries needed to run the tool.

Create a new file in your project folder named requirements.txt and add the following two lines to it:

requests
Then, commit and push this new file to your repository.

Bash

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Added requirements.txt file"
git push origin main
Step 2: Copy the README Content
Now, go to your GitHub repository, click on the README.md file, and click the pencil icon to edit it. Delete the existing content and paste the following:

# Website Security Scanner

A simple yet effective command-line tool built with Python to perform basic security reconnaissance on websites. This tool is designed for security enthusiasts, students, and developers to quickly check a target for common security misconfigurations.

## Key Features

-   **Multi-threaded Port Scanner:** Utilizes Python's built-in `socket` library to rapidly identify common open ports (`80`, `443`, `22`, etc.), revealing potential entry points. The use of a `ThreadPoolExecutor` ensures a fast and efficient scan.

-   **Security Header Analysis:** Employs the popular `requests` library to inspect a website's HTTP response headers, verifying the presence of crucial security configurations like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.

-   **Automated Reporting:** Generates a clean, easy-to-read text report consolidating all scan findings, which is automatically saved to a file for later review.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/theerakar/Website-Security-Scanner.git](https://github.com/theerakar/Website-Security-Scanner.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Website-Security-Scanner
    ```
3.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Tool
Run the script from your terminal, providing the target domain as an argument.

```bash
python scanner.py <target-domain>
Example:

Bash

python scanner.py securityheaders.com
Example Output
Here is an example of a scan report generated by the tool:

Scanning target: securityheaders.com

Starting Port Scan...
  [+] Port 80 is OPEN
  [+] Port 8080 is OPEN
  [+] Port 443 is OPEN

Port Scan Complete.

Starting Security Header Scan...
  [+] Checking for security headers:
    [+] Found 'X-Frame-Options' header.
    [+] Found 'X-Content-Type-Options' header.
Security Header Scan Complete.

--- Final Consolidated Report ---
Target: securityheaders.com

Port Scan Results:
  [+] Port 80 is OPEN
  [+] Port 8080 is OPEN
  [+] Port 443 is OPEN

Security Header Results:
  [-] 'Strict-Transport-Security' header is MISSING.
  [+] 'X-Frame-Options' header is PRESENT.
  [+] 'X-Content-Type-Options' header is PRESENT.
  [-] 'Content-Security-Policy' header is MISSING.
  [-] 'X-XSS-Protection' header is MISSING.

Scan Summary:
Total Open Ports: 3
Security Headers Found: 2 out of 5

Scan Complete.
